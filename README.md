## Document detail

### Project planning

To make an application showing the detail of the stock market, I prepared the following:

- Firebase â†’ to save user data and handle authentication
- Alpha Vantage â†’
    - to retrieve the time series data of a particular stock,
    - to retrieve the quote data of a stock
    - to search stock by symbol, common name or other terms
- polygon.io â†’
    - to retrieve the related news about the selected ticker
    - to retrieve the URL and logo of tickers

### Development process

Since I do not include any animation in the application, I simply draft the UI of each screen and based on the screen to create the corresponding data model.
